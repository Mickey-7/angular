=> on installation

npx @angular/cli new (project-name)
include routing and choose SCSS

=> generate component

npx ng g c components/(component-name) -it -is --skipTests

we have 3 components (navbar, users, user-detail)

1) go to app.component.html call the app-navbar component 
2) and also render the router-outlet which will be created on navbar
3) go to app-routing and code the necessary path & components
4) go to navbar html and code the routerLinks for the components
5) verify if the routing are okay

---------------------------------------------------------------------

=> generate interface first (must follow order of creation)

npx ng g i interface/(interface-name)

1) code all the parameters needed and specify the type of data

=> generate service second (must follow order of creation)

npx ng g s service/(service-name) --skipTests

make sure to import the service on app.module.ts on providers
like this code, providers:[UserService]

2) import the interface created and crete dummy data to be displayed 
3) also code all the services needed like CRUD method

4) to display the dummy data on the users.component.ts,
5) we need to import the service we created on the constructor of the component 
that we are going to display the dummy data with (in this case, its users.component.ts)
6) we also need to declare storage variable for the users like this: users:User[] as
users will be used on ngOnInit and in .html file for *ngFor="let user of users"
7) code the needed .html for users.component.html
