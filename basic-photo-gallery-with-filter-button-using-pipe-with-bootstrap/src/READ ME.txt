=> install bootstrap

npm install bootstrap@3

then paste below code on style.css

@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"

from style.css need to go up one folder so that the directory your currently in is now at node_modules

we have navbar, image & gallery components
the navbar will be the header, gallery will contain all the images
and the image will contain the selected specific image,
then go to app-routing.module.ts and code the path and components
and check the outputs on web browser

--------------------------------------------------------

=> creating  service

NOTE: dont forget to import the service on app.module.ts on providers:[ImageService]

create a image.service which contains the mock-data and the method of
getting all images and specific image then import that on image component

=> creating pipe

npx ng g pipe pipe/filter ---skipTests

NOTE: dont forget to manually import the class pipe on app.module.ts on 
providers:[FilterPipe] and declarations:[FilterPipe]

provide the pipe name, items & its datatype, criteria & its datatype , output & its datatype
and the logic condition for the following pipe and import it to gallery component as there
is where filtering happens, it should reflect on both .ts and .html file of that component

--------------------------------------------------------

the gallery components will contain images and will invoke the filter.pipe.ts
